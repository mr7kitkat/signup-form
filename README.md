The **Sign-Up Form** lesson on The Odin Project's Node.js Path (Intermediate HTML and CSS) is designed to guide you through the process of creating a functional and stylish sign-up form using HTML and CSS. This lesson focuses on building a clean, accessible, and responsive form that will allow users to input their details for account registration.

Throughout this exercise, you will learn how to:

- Structure a sign-up form with essential fields such as name, email, password, and a confirmation password.
- Apply CSS to style the form, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly across different devices.
- Incorporate form validation to ensure users enter the correct information (such as matching password fields).
- Use placeholder text, labels, and input types effectively to enhance accessibility and usability.
